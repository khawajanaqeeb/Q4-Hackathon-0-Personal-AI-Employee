I built an AI Employee for $0/month in cloud fees.

It manages my inbox, drafts my invoices, monitors my LinkedIn — and sends me a daily briefing every morning.

Here's the exact setup:

→ Python scripts watch Gmail, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp 24/7
→ Every message gets triaged and categorized automatically
→ Anything needing action lands in my approval queue
→ I approve or reject in one click
→ The AI handles the rest

Runs on my own machine. No SaaS subscriptions. No data leaving my computer.

In the first month it:
- Caught client messages I would have missed
- Auto-drafted a $1,500 invoice (sent after my approval)
- Saved ~15 hours of admin work
- Generated a full audit log of every action taken

The best part?

It never acts without my sign-off. Every external action — email, message, post — requires human approval first. Full automation, full control.

If you're a freelancer or consultant spending 3+ hours/day on inbox and admin work, you're leaving revenue on the table.

I'm building this system for select clients this quarter.

DM me "AUTOMATE" and I'll show you what's possible for your business.
