# Security Alert: LinkedIn Password Successfully Reset

## What Happened
Your LinkedIn password was **successfully reset** on **February 20, 2026 at 17:28 UTC** — just 2 minutes after the new device verification email.

## Action Required from You

**Did you reset your LinkedIn password on Feb 20, 2026?**

- **YES (it was you):** Move this file to `/Approved/` — I will archive as resolved.
- **NO (unauthorized):** Move this file to `/Approved/` with note "UNAUTHORIZED" — I will escalate immediately.

## Security Checklist (please verify)
- [ ] Confirm you can log into LinkedIn with your current password
- [ ] Check active sessions — revoke any unrecognised ones
- [ ] Review recent posts and messages for any unauthorized activity
- [ ] Enable 2FA if not already active

## Notes
This reset happened the same day as the LinkedIn Watcher setup session (Feb 20, 2026). This is likely legitimate if you reset the password as part of your LinkedIn watcher configuration. If so, both this and the new-device alert can be archived together.
