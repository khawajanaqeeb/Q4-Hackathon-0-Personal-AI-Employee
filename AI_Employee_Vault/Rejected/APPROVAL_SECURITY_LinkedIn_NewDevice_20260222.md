# Security Alert: LinkedIn New Device Verification

## What Happened
LinkedIn detected a login from a **new device** on your account and sent a verification email on **February 20, 2026 at 17:25 UTC**.

## Action Required from You

**Did you log into LinkedIn from a new device on Feb 20, 2026?**

- **YES (it was you):** Move this file to `/Approved/` — I will archive as resolved.
- **NO (not you):** Move this file to `/Approved/` with a note "UNAUTHORIZED" — I will escalate.

## Security Checklist (please verify)
- [ ] Check LinkedIn → Settings → Where You're Signed In
- [ ] Remove any unrecognised sessions
- [ ] Confirm your LinkedIn password is secure
- [ ] Enable 2FA if not already active

## Notes
This is recent (Feb 20, 2026). If you were setting up the LinkedIn Watcher using Playwright, this alert is expected — Playwright opens a new browser session which LinkedIn sees as a new device.
