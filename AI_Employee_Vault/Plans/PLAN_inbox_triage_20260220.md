# Plan: Inbox Triage — Stale P3 Files

## Objective

Categorize and archive two low-priority (P3) files found in Needs_Action that
are duplicates or test artifacts from earlier sessions.

## Files Reviewed

### 1. FILE_20260220_155922_PLAN_task_test.md
- **Type:** file_drop of `PLAN_task_test.md` (866 bytes)
- **Assessment:** This is a copy of an already-completed plan file that was
  accidentally re-dropped into the Inbox. The original `Plans/PLAN_task_test.md`
  exists and is already processed.
- **Action:** ✅ Archived to `/Done/` — no further action needed.

### 2. FILE_20260220_160352_task-test.md
- **Type:** file_drop of `task-test.md` (5 bytes — minimal test file)
- **Assessment:** Tiny test file dropped during Bronze Tier testing.
  Already processed in a prior session (see `Done/task-test.md`).
- **Action:** ✅ Archived to `/Done/` — no further action needed.

## Steps

- [x] Read both files
- [x] Assessed as stale/duplicate — no business action required
